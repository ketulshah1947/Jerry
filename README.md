# Running Python Tests from Terminal

This guide explains how to run Python tests using the terminal for this project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (You can check if Python is installed by running `python3 --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal)

## Steps to Run Tests

1. **Download and extract the zip file**:
   Download this assessment submission and extract to a location. 
2. **Open the Terminal**:
   Open a terminal window on your system. This can be Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (macOS/Linux), or any other terminal you prefer. 
   Navigate to the directory where you downloaded and extracted this project.
   Use the `cd` (change directory) command to move into the project directory.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project

3. **Run the Tests**:
   Once you're in the project directory, use the following command to run your Python tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest tests/IntensitySegmentsTests.py
   ```
   or 
   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest tests/IntensitySegmentsTests.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting
* **Python Not Found**:
   If Python is not recognized, make sure it is properly installed and added to your systemâ€™s PATH.
* **Module Not Found**: 
   If you see an error like ModuleNotFoundError, ensure that the Python module paths are correctly set up and that you are running the command from the correct directory.
